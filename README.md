# SYLLABUS

This repository documents my learning journey in **Machine Learning**, covering fundamental concepts, hands-on implementations, and practical experiments.  
It includes topics from **supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **deep learning with neural networks**.

    <h3>Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <p>Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an enviroment and improving its behavior based on rewards or penalties.</p>
    <p>For example</p>
    <h5>Types of RL</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Q-Learning</li>
    <li>SARSA
    </ul>
